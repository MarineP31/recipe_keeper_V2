## The Problem

### Recipe Fragmentation and Manual Organization
Home cooks accumulate recipes from diverse sources - physical cookbooks, handwritten family recipe cards, website screenshots, and social media posts - making it nearly impossible to maintain an organized, searchable collection. Manually typing recipes from physical sources is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to abandoned digitization efforts.

**Our Solution:** OCR technology automatically extracts recipe text from photos of cookbooks, handwritten cards, and screenshots, eliminating manual transcription while preserving recipes from any source in a unified digital collection.

### Disconnected Meal Planning and Shopping
Meal planning typically involves juggling multiple apps, notes, and physical recipe sources, then manually compiling ingredient lists from chosen recipes. This fragmented workflow creates friction that discourages consistent meal planning and leads to inefficient grocery shopping.

**Our Solution:** Integrated meal planning with a visual calendar interface and automatic shopping list generation creates a seamless flow from recipe selection to grocery shopping, making meal prep efficient and stress-free.

## Differentiators

### OCR-Powered Recipe Digitization
Unlike traditional recipe apps that require manual entry or web imports, we provide camera-based OCR that instantly digitizes recipes from physical sources. Snap a photo of a cookbook page or handwritten recipe card, and our OCR technology extracts ingredients, instructions, cooking times, and servings automatically. This preserves family heirloom recipes and consolidates your entire collection without tedious typing.

### Mobile-First Local Storage
Unlike cloud-based recipe apps that require accounts and subscriptions, Recipe Keeper V2 works entirely offline with local storage. Your recipes stay private on your device, accessible instantly without internet connectivity. This provides complete privacy, zero subscription costs, and eliminates concerns about service shutdowns or data breaches.

### Unified Recipe Management to Meal Planning Workflow
Unlike apps that focus solely on recipe storage or meal planning, we seamlessly connect the entire workflow. Drag recipes into your weekly meal plan, automatically compile shopping lists from planned meals, and check off items as you shop. This integrated approach eliminates app-switching and manual list-making, transforming meal prep from a chore into an efficient routine.
