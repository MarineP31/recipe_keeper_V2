# Spec Requirements: Recipe Detail View

## Initial Description
Recipe Detail View

Create a comprehensive recipe detail screen that displays full recipe information including ingredients, step-by-step instructions, cooking times, servings, tags, source attribution, and action buttons for editing, deleting, and adding to meal plans.

## Product Context

### Product Mission Alignment
This feature aligns with Recipe Keeper V2's mission to help meal preppers organize recipes from diverse sources. The detail view serves as the primary interface for users to:
- View complete recipe information in a clear, readable format
- Access recipes from their consolidated digital collection
- Take actions on recipes (edit, delete, add to meal planning)
- Navigate seamlessly between recipe viewing and meal planning workflows

### Roadmap Position
This is feature #8 in Phase 1 (MVP), sized as Small (S). It follows the Recipe Repository UI and Recipe Editor features, and works alongside the Meal Planning Calendar. This is a foundational viewing interface that enables the core recipe management workflow.

## Requirements Discussion

### First Round Questions

**Q1:** How should the recipe image be displayed? Should it be a full-width hero image at the top, or a smaller thumbnail alongside the title?
**Answer:** Recipe image should be displayed as a full-width hero image at the top of the screen.

**Q2:** What's the priority order for displaying information? I'm assuming: Image → Title → Source/Tags → Prep/Cook Time + Servings → Ingredients → Instructions. Is that correct?
**Answer:** Image → Title → Source/Tags → Prep/Cook Time + Servings → Ingredients → Instructions

**Q3:** For the action buttons (edit, delete, add to meal plan), should they be in a fixed header/footer, or inline with the content? I'm thinking fixed header with icon buttons for easy access while scrolling.
**Answer:** Three action buttons: "Edit", "Delete", and "Add to Queue" in the header.

**Q4:** How should ingredients be displayed? As a simple list, or with interactive checkboxes for users to mark off while cooking?
**Answer:** Ingredients should display as a simple formatted list showing "quantity unit name" (e.g., "2 cups flour"). Keep it as static display for MVP.

**Q5:** Should instruction steps be numbered automatically, or display exactly as entered in the editor? I'm assuming we auto-number for consistency.
**Answer:** Instructions should be numbered steps in a clean vertical list format. Keep it simple for MVP.

**Q6:** For the metadata (prep time, cook time, servings), should this be displayed in a structured info bar or inline with the text? I'm thinking a horizontal info bar with icons for visual clarity.
**Answer:** Display this in a horizontal info bar below the title (with icons for visual clarity).

**Q7:** For source attribution, should we handle URLs differently from text sources (e.g., make URLs tappable links)?
**Answer:** Always plain text for MVP.

**Q8:** How should we handle recipes without images? Show a placeholder, or collapse that section entirely?
**Answer:** Handle missing images with a default placeholder image.

**Q9:** Where do users access this screen from? I'm assuming from the recipe list (tap a card), but should it also be accessible after creating/editing a recipe?
**Answer:** Users access this screen from the recipe list (tap card), after creating/editing a recipe, or from the queue screen. The action buttons adapt based on context.

**Q10:** Should the screen support any special gestures (swipe to next recipe, pinch to zoom image)?
**Answer:** Single ScrollView with the image scrolling up with the content.

**Q11:** Are there any cooking-mode specific features needed (e.g., keep screen awake, timer integration, voice control)?
**Answer:** Keep it simple for MVP (no cooking mode features, timers, stay-awake, voice control, scaling servings).

**Q12:** What should we explicitly exclude from this feature to keep scope manageable?
**Answer:** Not explicitly answered - assume exclude all Phase 3 features (cooking mode, timers, voice control, servings scaling, ingredient checkboxes, step completion).

### Existing Code to Reference
No similar existing features identified for reference. This is a foundational MVP feature being built from scratch.

### Visual Assets

└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Hero image dominates top of screen (full-width)
- Title is large and bold
- Metadata info bar is visually grouped with icons
- Clear section breaks between ingredients and instructions
- Consistent spacing and typography throughout

**Design Principles:**
- Clean, readable layout optimized for recipe viewing
- Static display (no interactive cooking features)
- Sufficient white space for comfortable reading
- Clear visual grouping of related information
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility: good contrast, readable font sizes, clear tap targets

**Color and Typography:**
- Follow app's existing design system
- Use icons to reinforce metadata meaning (clock for times, serving dish for servings)
- Consistent with Recipe Repository card design for brand continuity

### Component Structure Recommendations

**Screen Component:**
- `RecipeDetailScreen` - Main screen component

**Sub-Components:**
- `RecipeHeader` - Fixed header with action buttons
- `RecipeHeroImage` - Full-width image with placeholder fallback
- `RecipeTitle` - Styled title text
- `RecipeMetaInfo` - Source and tags display
- `RecipeInfoBar` - Horizontal bar with prep/cook/servings icons
- `IngredientsList` - Formatted ingredient list
- `InstructionsList` - Auto-numbered instruction steps

**Shared Components:**
- `IconButton` - For header actions
- `PlaceholderImage` - Default recipe image
- `Tag` - Tag display component (if exists)
- `Icon` - Icon components for info bar

### Context-Aware Behavior Details

**Navigation Context Handling:**

1. **From Recipe List:**
   - Show all three buttons: Edit, Delete, Add to Queue
   - Back navigation returns to recipe list

2. **After Creating Recipe:**
   - Show all three buttons: Edit, Delete, Add to Queue
   - Back navigation may return to recipe list or editor depending on flow

3. **After Editing Recipe:**
   - Show all three buttons: Edit, Delete, Add to Queue
   - Back navigation may return to recipe list or previous screen

4. **From Queue Screen:**
   - Consider hiding "Add to Queue" button (already in queue)
   - Or change button to "Remove from Queue"
   - Edit and Delete remain available
   - Back navigation returns to queue screen

**Implementation Note:** Navigation parameters should include source context to enable appropriate button configuration.
