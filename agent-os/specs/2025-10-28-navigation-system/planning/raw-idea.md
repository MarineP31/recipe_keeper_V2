# Raw Idea: Navigation System Implementation

## User Description

Implement comprehensive navigation system for Recipe Keeper V2, including navigation to recipe details, recipe creation/editing, and proper screen transitions. This should integrate with the existing Recipe Repository UI and prepare the foundation for future features.

## Context

- We have just completed the Recipe Repository UI (browsing, search, filtering)
- The app currently shows placeholder alerts when tapping recipe cards or the FAB
- We need to implement full navigation between screens
- The app uses Expo Router for navigation
