# Spec Requirements: Navigation System Implementation

## Initial Description

Implement comprehensive navigation system for Recipe Keeper V2, including navigation to recipe details, recipe creation/editing, and proper screen transitions. This should integrate with the existing Recipe Repository UI and prepare the foundation for future features.

## Context

- We have just completed the Recipe Repository UI (browsing, search, filtering)
- The app currently shows placeholder alerts when tapping recipe cards or the FAB
- We need to implement full navigation between screens
- The app uses Expo Router for navigation

## Requirements Discussion

### First Round Questions

**Q1: Navigation Architecture - What level of navigation complexity do we need?**

I'm assuming we need tab-based navigation with a bottom bar, plus stack navigation within each tab for things like recipe details. Is that correct, or do you prefer a different structure (like drawer navigation or simple stack only)?

**Answer:** Tab-based navigation with bottom bar and stack navigation within tabs is correct.

**Q2: Bottom Navigation Tabs - Which main sections should appear as tabs?**

Based on Recipe Keeper, I'm thinking:
- Home (recipe list - your current RecipeRepositoryScreen)
- Add Recipe (probably opens a form or camera)
- Shopping List
- Profile/Settings

Should we use these four tabs, or do you have different sections in mind?

**Answer:** Home and Shopping List are correct. Instead of Profile/Settings, we need a Meal Plan tab. The Add Recipe tab should trigger a choice screen (camera vs manual entry).

**Q3: Recipe Card Tap Behavior - What should happen when a user taps a recipe card?**

I assume tapping a recipe card should navigate to a Recipe Detail screen showing the full recipe. Should this detail screen have actions like Edit, Delete, Add to Meal Plan? Or should those actions be in a different place (like a context menu on the list)?

**Answer:** Yes, navigate to Recipe Detail screen. Actions should be in a bottom sheet accessed via an "actions" button (three dots). Bottom sheet actions: Edit Recipe, Delete Recipe. Note: "Add to Meal Plan" should be a floating action button on the recipe detail screen, NOT in the bottom sheet.

**Q4: Add Recipe Tab Flow - How should the Add Recipe tab work?**

When the user taps the Add Recipe tab, should it:
A) Immediately open the camera for photo capture?
B) Go directly to a manual recipe entry form?
C) Show a choice screen where they can select Camera or Manual Entry?

**Answer:** Option C - Show a choice screen (Camera vs Manual Entry) that navigates to the appropriate screen.

**Q5: Shopping List Navigation - Should shopping list items link back to recipes?**

I'm assuming the Shopping List should allow users to tap on an item/ingredient to navigate to the source recipe details. Is this correct, or should the shopping list be standalone without recipe navigation?

**Answer:** Yes, navigate to recipe details from shopping list items.

**Q6: Meal Planning Access - Where should meal planning features be accessed?**

Should meal planning be:
A) A fourth tab in the bottom navigation?
B) Accessed from the Profile/Settings tab?
C) A modal that appears when adding recipes to meal plan?
D) Something else?

**Answer:** Option A - A fourth tab in the bottom navigation.

**Q7: Bottom Sheet Library - Which bottom sheet library should we use?**

For the bottom sheet (actions menu on recipe detail), should we use:
- @gorhom/bottom-sheet (popular, feature-rich)
- react-native-bottom-sheet
- A custom implementation
- Another library you prefer?

**Answer:** @gorhom/bottom-sheet (need to install this library).

**Q8: Navigation Guards - Should we prevent navigation when there are unsaved changes?**

If a user is filling out a recipe form and tries to navigate away, should we:
A) Show a confirmation dialog ("You have unsaved changes, are you sure?")
B) Auto-save as draft
C) Just let them navigate away (lose changes)
D) Different behavior depending on the screen?

**Answer:** Show confirmation dialog, but only on the Add/Edit Recipe form. Dialog options: Save / Discard / Cancel.

**Q9: Edit Recipe Navigation - How should editing work?**

When a user wants to edit a recipe, should we:
A) Navigate to the same Add Recipe screen but pre-fill it with the recipe data?
B) Have a separate Edit Recipe screen?
C) Use an in-place editing mode on the detail screen?

**Answer:** Option A - Use the same Add Recipe screen but pre-filled with data. This means the form can be in "create" or "edit" mode.

**Q10: Android Back Button - Should we handle the Android back button specially?**

On Android, users often use the hardware/gesture back button. Should this:
- Follow standard stack navigation behavior (just pop)?
- Also trigger the unsaved changes dialog when appropriate?
- Have special handling for certain screens?

**Answer:** Show the same confirmation dialog as gesture navigation when there are unsaved changes.

**Q11: Scope Boundaries - Are there any features explicitly out of scope?**

Is there anything navigation-related we should NOT implement in this spec? For example:
- Deep linking to specific recipes?
- Tab persistence (remembering which tab was active)?
- Custom transitions/animations?
- Gesture-based navigation?

**Answer:** Focus on core navigation structure. Deep linking, custom transitions, and advanced gesture-based navigation are out of scope for this spec. Tab persistence using Expo Router defaults is fine.

### Existing Code to Reference

**Similar Features Identified:**
- Current RecipeRepositoryScreen implements the recipe list/browsing interface at `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- Tab navigation structure already exists with basic Expo Router setup
- Recipe data models and types in `types/` directory can be referenced for detail screen implementation

### Follow-up Questions

**Follow-up 1: Bottom Sheet Actions Clarification**

You mentioned Edit, Delete, and "Add to Meal Plan" as a FAB. Just to confirm the complete interaction flow:
- User taps recipe card → Navigate to Recipe Detail
- User taps three-dot actions button on detail screen → Bottom sheet appears with Edit/Delete
- User sees "Add to Meal Plan" as a separate floating action button (not in bottom sheet)
- Is this correct?

**Answer:** Confirmed. Bottom sheet has Edit Recipe and Delete Recipe. "Add to Meal Plan" is a floating button on the recipe detail screen (NOT in bottom sheet).

**Follow-up 2: Add Recipe Tab Flow Confirmation**

For the Add Recipe tab showing a choice screen - should this choice screen be:
- A persistent screen that's always shown when tapping the tab?
- Or does it navigate to Camera/Form and then reset back to the choice screen when returning to the tab?

**Answer:** Show a choice screen (Camera vs Manual Entry) that navigates to the appropriate screen. The tab should show the choice screen as its root.

**Follow-up 3: Shopping List Navigation Details**

When navigating to recipe details from shopping list items - should this use the same Recipe Detail screen as navigating from the Home tab? And should the back button from there return to the Shopping List?

**Answer:** Yes, use the same Recipe Detail screen. Navigation should properly return to the Shopping List tab.

**Follow-up 4: Unsaved Changes Scope**

You mentioned the unsaved changes dialog should only appear on Add/Edit Recipe form. Should this apply to:
- Only the manual recipe entry form?
- Or also the camera/OCR flow if they've captured a photo?

**Answer:** Only Add/Edit Recipe form. The camera/OCR flow is handled separately.

**Follow-up 5: Edit Recipe Navigation Clarification**

When using the same Add Recipe screen in "edit mode" - how should the navigation work:
- User taps Edit in bottom sheet → Navigate to Add Recipe screen (pre-filled)
- Does this push onto the stack (so back button returns to detail)?
- Or does it navigate to the Add Recipe tab and somehow pre-fill it there?

**Answer:** Navigate to the same Add Recipe screen (which is in the Add Recipe tab) but pre-filled with data in edit mode. This should push onto the current stack, so back button returns to the recipe detail screen.

**Follow-up 6: Android Back Button Behavior**

For Android back button - should it:
- Show the unsaved changes dialog when navigating back from Add/Edit Recipe form?
- Follow normal stack behavior everywhere else?

**Answer:** Yes, show the same confirmation dialog as gesture navigation. Treat Android back button the same as iOS back gesture.
