## Execution Order

Recommended implementation sequence:

1. **Foundation Layer** (Task Group 1) - 3-4 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Establishes navigation architecture and route structure
   - Enables all subsequent navigation work

2. **Bottom Sheet Integration** (Task Group 2) - 2-3 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Installs library and creates reusable component
   - Required for recipe detail screen actions

3. **Recipe Detail Screen** (Task Group 3) - 4-5 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Core feature for viewing recipes
   - Depends on navigation and bottom sheet
   - Enables testing of cross-tab navigation

4. **Add Recipe Choice Screen** (Task Group 4) - 2-3 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Simpler screen, can be done in parallel with detail
   - Entry point to recipe creation flow

5. **Recipe Form Implementation** (Task Group 5) - 6-7 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Most complex feature with validation and dynamic fields
   - Requires detail screen for edit mode integration

6. **Unsaved Changes Protection** (Task Group 6) - 3-4 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Enhances recipe form with safety features
   - Depends on form implementation being complete

7. **Testing & Polish** (Task Group 7) - 3-4 hours (COMPLETED)
   - Final validation and integration testing
   - Ensures all features work together correctly
   - Performance and accessibility verification

**Total Estimated Time:** 24-31 hours (3-4 days for one developer)

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**
- Task Groups 2 and 4 can be done in parallel after Task Group 1
- Task Group 3 requires Task Group 2 to be complete
- Task Group 5 should wait for Task Group 3 (edit mode needs detail screen)
- Task Group 6 must follow Task Group 5
- Task Group 7 must be last
